            <p id="tributeInfo">On December 26, 1990, Mama Coleen's bakery opened in San Tan Valley, Arizona.  It has been 
            a staple in the community for over 30 years and still serves the East Valley with a wide variety of cakes, pies, 
            cookies, and specialty items. Mama Coleen has been baking for over 50 years and doesn't seem to be slowing down 
            any time soon!
